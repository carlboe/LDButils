#' @title saveRbirths2M reformat R LDB Births internal data.frame to matlab format and save out.
#' 
#' @description this function does as promised. Given the standard R data.frame as created by \code{readInputDB()}, it'll reshuffle columns and change character values to integer or numeric as required to meet the LDB matlab expectations. R scripts use column names as identifiers, whereas matlab scripts use indices. The matlab code rearranges indices as well, and sheds some columns, which necessitates specialty functions such as this.
#' 
#' @param BirthsRDF is the R Births data.frame, as returned by \code{readInputDB()}, and used downstream. It gets converted to a matrix according to the HMD matlab legacy standards and saved out as a matlab file
#' @param full.path.mat the full path to where you want the matlab matrix saved, including the \code{.mat} suffix.
#' 
#' @importFrom R.matlab writeMat

#' @export
